        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
                <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C (350 degrees F). Grease 3 mini loaf pans.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light in color and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla extract; beat in mashed bananas.</li>
                <li>Add flour mixture a little at a time, beating until just combined into a thick batter. Fold in blueberries until evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer loaves to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Eat! (Not necessarily all 3 loaves)</li>
            </ol>
